# Koopman Autoencoders for cyclone prediction, conserved value discovery, and data synthesis
This repository is focused on three main tasks:
* Predicting the path of cyclones at a certain pressure level in the atmosphere
* Use a linear layer to approximate a Koopman operator (allows for linear stability analysis, eigenfunction discovery, etc.)
* Using Koopman eigenvectors to generate synthetic data for further improvement on prediction accuracy

This work is based on the paper [Forecasting Sequential Data Using Consistent Koopman Autoencoders](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/azencot20a/azencot20a.pdf).

## Path prediction

## Stability analysis, conserved values

## Generation of synthetic data
